[Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119) initially started with the [Dridex](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0384) banking Trojan, and then by 2017 they began running ransomware operations using [BitPaymer](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0570), [WastedLocker](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0612), and Hades ransomware. Following U.S. sanctions and an indictment in 2019, [Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119) changed their tactics and diversified their toolset.(Citation: Crowdstrike Indrik November 2018)(Citation: Crowdstrike EvilCorp March 2021)(Citation: Treasury EvilCorp Dec 2019)",

      "description": "[OilRig](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049) is a suspected Iranian threat group that has targeted Middle Eastern and international victims since at least 2014. The group has targeted a variety of sectors, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications. It appears the group carries out supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets. The group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.(Citation: FireEye APT34 Dec 2017)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig April 2017)(Citation: ClearSky OilRig Jan 2017)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig May 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig Oct 2016)(Citation: Unit42 OilRig Playbook 2023)(Citation: Unit 42 QUADAGENT July 2018)",

      "description": "[Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat group attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). (Citation: US-CERT HIDDEN COBRA June 2017) (Citation: Treasury North Korean Cyber Groups September 2019) [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) has been active since at least 2009 and is reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, identified by Novetta as part of Operation Blockbuster. Malware used by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)\n\nNorth Korea’s cyber operations have shown a consistent pattern of adaptation, forming and reorganizing units as national priorities shift. These units frequently share personnel, infrastructure, malware, and tradecraft, making it difficult to attribute specific operations with high confidence. Public reporting often uses “Lazarus Group” as an umbrella term for multiple North Korean cyber operators conducting espionage, destructive attacks, and financially motivated campaigns.(Citation: Mandiant DPRK Laz Org Breakdown 2022)(Citation: Mandiant DPRK Groups 2023)(Citation: JPCert Blog Laz Subgroups 2025)\n\n",

      "description": "[Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) is a China-based threat group that has been active since at least 2021 deploying multiple strains of ransomware based on the leaked [Babuk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0638) source code. [Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) does not operate their ransomware on an affiliate model or purchase access but appears to act independently in all stages of the attack lifecycle. Based on victimology, the short lifespan of each ransomware variant, and use of malware attributed to government-sponsored threat groups, [Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) may be motivated by intellectual property theft or cyberespionage rather than financial gain.(Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service)(Citation: Microsoft Threat Actor Naming July 2023)(Citation: Trend Micro Cheerscrypt May 2022)(Citation: SecureWorks BRONZE STARLIGHT Ransomware Operations June 2022)",

The group initially targeted South Korean government agencies, think tanks, and subject-matter experts in various fields. Its operations expanded to include the United Nations and organizations in the government, education, business services, and manufacturing sectors across the United States, Japan, Russia, and Europe. [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) has focused collection on foreign policy and national security issues tied to the Korean Peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions. Its operations have overlapped with other DPRK actors, likely due to ad hoc collaboration or limited resource sharing.(Citation: EST Kimsuky April 2019)(Citation: Cybereason Kimsuky November 2020)(Citation: Malwarebytes Kimsuky June 2021)(Citation: CISA AA20-301A Kimsuky)(Citation: Mandiant APT43 March 2024)(Citation: Proofpoint TA427 April 2024) Because of overlapping operations, some researchers group a wide range of North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the broader [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) umbrella rather than tracking separate subgroup or cluster distinctions.\n\n[Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) was assessed to be responsible for the 2014 Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. compromise; other notable campaigns include Operation STOLEN PENCIL (2018), Operation Kabar Cobra (2019), and Operation Smoke Screen (2019).(Citation: Netscout Stolen Pencil Dec 2018)(Citation: EST Kimsuky SmokeScreen April 2019)(Citation: AhnLab Kimsuky Kabar Cobra Feb 2019)\n\nIn 2023, [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) was observed using commercial large language models to assist with vulnerability research, scripting, social engineering and reconnaissance.(Citation: MSFT-AI)",
